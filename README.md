# Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates biology and computer science to effectively analyze and interpret extensive and complex datasets.

# Data types: 
Genomic Data (including WGS and WES):

Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Data: Comprehensive sequencing of the entire DNA of an organism.

Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) Data: Focused sequencing of all protein-coding regions in the genome.

Transcriptomic Data: Analysis of RNA transcripts to understand gene expression patterns.

Proteomic Data: Study of the full set of proteins produced in a biological system.

Metabolomic Data: Analysis of metabolites to understand metabolic processes and organism responses.

Epigenetic Data: Study of heritable changes in gene function that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence.

Phylogenetic Data: Analysis of evolutionary relationships among organisms or genes.

Structural Biology Data: Information about the 3D structure of biological molecules.

Microbiome Data: Study of microbial communities in specific environments.

Population Genetics Data: Genetic variation across populations, useful for understanding evolutionary processes.

Clinical Data: Patient-specific data combining genomic, proteomic, and other omics data.

Chemoinformatics Data: Study of chemical substances and their interactions in biological systems.

Pathway Data: Information on biological pathways, key for understanding cellular processes.

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) Data: Scans of genomes to find genetic markers associated with specific traits or diseases.

Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Data: Study of genetic variations among individuals.

Copy Number Variation (CNV) Data: Study of variations in the number of copies of a particular gene.

Interactomics Data: Data related to the study of interactomes, which are the whole set of molecular interactions in a particular cell. This includes protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, and other types of interactions within the cell. It's crucial for understanding the functional networks and pathways in biological systems and how alterations in these networks can lead to disease.
