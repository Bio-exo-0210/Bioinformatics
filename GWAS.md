GWAS helps in finding the connections between specific genetic variations (known as SNPs) and certain diseases or physical traits.

# GWAS data types.

# Genotyping data
1.	SNPs, are the most common type of genetic variations among the samples. In GWAS, hundreds of thousands to millions of SNPs across the genome are genotyped for each sample.
2.	Genotyping data comes from genotyping platforms like SNP arrays or chips.
3.	Genotyping data is mostly provided in formats like PLINK (bed, bim, and fam files). These files contain information about the SNP genotypes of each sample. 
4.	Genotyping data can come from traditional “Genotyping arrays” or by an alternative approach called “Sequencing.” 

                                                                
# Phenotyping data
1.	The phenotype of interest which could be a specific disease, physical trait, or biochemical measurement.
2.	Additional data like age, sex, ethnicity, and other clinical parameters are also considered phenotypic data.
